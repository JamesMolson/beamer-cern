# The CERN Logo

It's not provided here but there are official [CERN logos available for
download](https://design-guidelines.web.cern.ch/downloads).
Download the [*CERN logo
pack*](https://design-guidelines.web.cern.ch/sites/design-guidelines.web.cern.ch/files/downloads/CERN-LogoPack.zip).

A quick and dirty way to include a suitable logo is to copy the
`CERN-LogoPack/Outline/PNG/WHITE/LogoOutline-04.png` file to the directory
where your slides are. Rename it to `cern-logo.png`.

A cleaner way would involve using a vector graphics editor such as
[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) and editing the `CERN-LogoPack/Outline/Format
PAO/LogoOutline.svg` file to turn the logo outline white. Then export it as a
PDF file to the directory where your slides are. Rename it to `cern-logo.pdf`.
